# Introduction

In this project I designed a database for a health clinic in order for them to add employees, patients and their data. Also, the DBA should run three piece of queries to first update the inventory, based on the updated inventory should put in the daily purchases and also, replenish the inventory if necessary.

# Usage

This database can be used in an health clinic in order to follow up and schedule their appointment with their patients. Also, you can use this database scheme in any health clinic. It is a preliminary database that other features can be built on top of it such as authentication of doctors and accessing the patients file.

# Requirements

This database is designed in  PostgreSQL and you can find the installation by clicking [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). I used a RDBMS criterias to design the database. Both [Conceptual Schema](ConceptualSchema.png) and [Physical Schema](PhysicalSchema.png). The database gets populated when you run the queries so you can have test patients and employees. These can be deleted and new patients can be added. All codes are commented for ease of use.
